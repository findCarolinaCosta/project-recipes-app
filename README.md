## Project report
It was very good to do this project as a group, making an end-to-end web application was a challenge and being able to do it as a team made it a lot easier, breaking the big problems into small ones and thus reducing its complexity and making it easy to solve. 
I thank all the members of the group, Trybe and myself for having managed to progress with always help and a lot of resilience.
